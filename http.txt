#summary on http(hypertext transfer ptotocol)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Key points include:

Client-Server Model:

HTTP operates on a client-server model, where clients (browsers) request resources from servers.
Request and Response Cycle:

Clients send HTTP requests to servers for resources, and servers respond with the requested data.
HTTP Methods:

Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
Status Codes:

Status codes like 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error) indicate the outcome of a request.
Statelessness:

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent, without knowledge of previous requests.
