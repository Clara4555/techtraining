#summary of git
Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Key concepts include:

Repositories:

Git repositories store versioned project files and their history.
Commits:

Commits represent a snapshot of changes made to files. Each commit has a unique identifier.
Branching:

Branches allow parallel development, enabling the creation of new features without affecting the main codebase.
Merging:

Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch.
Remote Repositories:

Remote repositories, often hosted on platforms like GitHub, enable collaboration among multiple developers.
